# Pastel flatpak

This was some experimentation at turning [pastel](https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel) into a flatpak. The project builds successfully into `io.github.sharkdp.pastel`, and includes a desktop file which runs the color-picker as a GUI-only application.

This runs on `v0.9.0`, and will not be maintained or updated.
